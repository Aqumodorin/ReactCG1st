1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,320
So we had a look at radium which is one package that helps us with styling React Components.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:17,270
Another very popular package and third party library you can use for dad is styled components to styled

3
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,840
components library.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,150
Now what are styled components or what does this library about.

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,800
This library is all about.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,490
Guess what.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,730
Styling components and making that very simple on style dash components dot com.

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,880
You can learn all about it here if you click on documentation.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,640
But of course I want to introduce you to this library and show you the core basics of it.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,980
In this course now to get started with that library with first of all have to install it.

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,410
And for that we can run this command here.

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,990
So simply copy this

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,470
and then quit your development server and simply run npm install dash dash save style dash components

14
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,590
in your react project and this will now install this package as a dependency.

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:14,120
In the meantime I will already get rid of my radium import here and all of the radium wrapper down there.

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,030
They are for all temporarily keep this around so that they can copy and paste to stall later but will

17
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,080
not set it up like this soon in AB jars.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:32,120
I'll also get rid of radium of this import here and in their deal for all also get rid of the radium

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,490
wrapper we have at the bottom.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,330
So let's make sure we get rid of all our radium traces here so that we're not using radium anywhere

21
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:48,710
because we're now going to switch and we're going to basically use C as as styling or CSX in JavaScript

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,310
styling with the help of this package.

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,290
So with it installed how does this package work.

24
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,990
How can we use styled components.

25
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,780
Of course the official docs or you official page has got you covered regarding that as well.

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,100
And what you see there is that in the annual import one thing from that stalled components package and

27
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:17,250
then you have this strange syntax down there and now it is is something you might have never seen before.

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,100
There is back tick back tick thing here after some of our code.

29
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,640
This is regular javascript though it's a feature called tacked templates and attached you find a link

30
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,950
where you can learn more about it.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,490
It has nothing to do with react that is a way lable in vanilla javascript as well.

32
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:41,210
And in the end what this here is is a function call so button here would be a function or a method on

33
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:47,840
the stalled object to be precise and instead of having parentheses with function arguments as you're

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,010
used to you instead have to back takes between which you can pass text and then this text is the and

35
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:02,390
passed into the spot method in a special way which we don't have to care about where you can learn more

36
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,370
about than this attached link.

37
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,130
We just have to note that it will be passed into this but method here in such a way that this method

38
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:17,360
uses whatever you pass this text here as styling for this well button which this method creates back

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,510
takes in general can be used in javascript to create a so-called template literal.

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,850
So even without dad combination of a method with back takes you can't create strings in javascript with

41
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,370
just back takes and attached you all to find a link which introduces you to template liberals in case

42
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,310
you're not aware of them it's a regular jobs good feature has nothing to do with react but this becomes

43
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,800
cleaner if we use it.

44
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,740
So let's go back to our project and we want to style the dev here in the example of person J s right.

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:57,440
So in order to do that let's first of all import styled from styled dash components.

46
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:06,570
And then here instead of using the div like this year let's comment this out and let's instead return

47
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,300
styled dot death.

48
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,600
This styled object which we're importing from styled components basically has a method for every H2

49
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,430
male element.

50
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,510
You could create.

51
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,750
So you have div here you have the button here you have an anchor tag you have paragraph you have a h1

52
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,540
tag end zones have all these H Tim l elements a way double here as methods.

53
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,820
And here we want to render a death.

54
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,780
So we use death now as you see in the official docs then we use this strange syntax div in the end as

55
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,200
a function but we don't call it as such.

56
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,890
Instead we use this tact template approach and add to back takes after it.

57
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,820
So did we have style div like this.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Now the obvious question is what goes between these two back ticks here though between these back takes

59
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,480
go your styles.

60
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:09,660
So here we can actually go to the person C as as file comment this temporarily back in and then copy

61
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,410
this entire style and then commented all out if we want to actually remove or comment out the person

62
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:23,160
C assess the import here and now between these two back ticks we add our style however without the person

63
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:32,460
selector instead just the style properties like this so that we simply say this div should have these

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:41,760
styles now we can all add a media query here again without this selector though just with the property

65
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,420
we want to apply and the styled components package behind the scenes we'll make sure that these styles

66
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,270
including the media query end up on this def which is created here now at the moment we have invalid

67
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:01,230
code though we have some other code down there which should go between our two div tax the div opening

68
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,060
and closing tag.

69
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,840
So actually the solution here is or one solution is to grab this cactus and create a new component here.

70
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,460
So here we can create a new component style div maybe and there we create are styled death with this

71
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:25,970
template tag syntax copy in all that CSX code here without selectors.

72
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,840
As mentioned

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,420
and we'll be good to go.

74
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,510
Now important here.

75
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm starting with the upper case character because I plan on using this component right in this file

76
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
down here.

77
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,600
I now use stall div as a regular react component because that's really important.

78
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:53,290
Every method provided by this styled object no matter if that's div age 1 or whatever it is returns

79
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,430
a react component.

80
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,670
So here we're not creating a react component where we get props and returns J is x.

81
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,330
No because this already returns our ReACT component so this already is a functional or class based.

82
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,200
We don't know component.

83
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,810
So instead of creating a function here a functional component we just stored the result of this method

84
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,630
call in our style.

85
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,620
They've constant here because this already is a valid react component provided by that third party library

86
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:29,380
and with Dad we can restart our development server here so that we can see this in action.

87
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,350
Make sure you're using a recent version of React for this.

88
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,720
In my case I'm using react 16 dots 10

89
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,350
and then you should be able to click on toggle persons and actually see what you saw before and just

90
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:52,080
to prove that this works if I remove the media query you see now I have these bigger boxes here on bigger

91
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,260
screens always 60 percent of my screen with if I re added and save and toggle you see now this width

92
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,500
gets applied.

93
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,820
So now the style components Library is doing its job and is styling these components and therefore again

94
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,000
we have a nice mixture of CSX and JavaScript all in one file with help of these stalled components.
