1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,690
Now let's also apply.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:10,240
See ISS modules to person J.S. so there instead of hostile they've all used a regular div here just

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,930
like this.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:17,980
Basically what we had before but now I will import from the C as file again again using this syntax

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,430
beer to import classes from that file.

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,290
Now we can get rid of that style.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,700
If we don't need it anymore.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,800
We don't need that import anymore.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,760
And now here I just want to add class name classes stopped and now it's up to you what you want to use

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,440
there.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,540
And here I'll assign a dot Person class and that means said now in Person C S S we need to ensure that

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,870
we have such a person class which we do.

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:50,410
And then again this will be transformed to a unique random or pseudo random class name and b mapped

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,830
to disperse some property on this imported object so that we can access t generated class name here

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,720
and assign it to the death.

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,630
And of course here we can then all ze was immediate query just like this.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,410
This will work because in here.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,520
And that's really important with CSX modules.

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,910
You write regular CSX code you have normal CSX files.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,130
Just the way you add them is special and they are for now here we toggled is.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:25,780
We have our same person style we had before where the boxes don't get wider than four hundred and fifty

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,540
pixels and Oberweis take up 60 percent of the width.

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,820
So this is CSX modules and ultimately it's of course up to you what you prefer.

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:42,240
I'm just a fan of having my javascript code and the as this code separated and we've CSX modules that's

25
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:50,140
very simple whilst at the same time having the power of scoping CSX to certain components so did what

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:57,220
we defined here on this person clause does not apply to every person class in the entire app but only

27
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:03,060
two person clauses used in the files where we import from the person see as file like this.

28
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,710
And this is a syntax which I therefore like a lot if you prefer one of the obvious in Texas.

29
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,430
You can of course use data as well you can use styled components or radium throughout this course.

30
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:20,860
However I will use see us as modules just as shown here because of these splitting of CSX and JavaScript

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,760
which in my opinion also makes it easier to focus on javascript no one last word about an alternative

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,180
way of using C as as modules if you're using react scripts to dot X or higher.

33
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,870
When I mentioned that you eject I mentioned dead you only need to do this on Version 1 if you're using

34
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,480
Q Dot X or higher.

35
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,590
You can use the syntax automatically.

36
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,940
The only addition you need to do is you need to import from DOT modules CSX and rename your CSX fall

37
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:59,150
to dock module dot CSX and then this will automatically work without ejecting here.

38
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,600
I'll not do it because we already did eject and it's fine like this but if you are using a later version

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,920
of React scripts you can save the eject step and just import from a dot module CSX file and see us as

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,450
modules will be unlocked.
