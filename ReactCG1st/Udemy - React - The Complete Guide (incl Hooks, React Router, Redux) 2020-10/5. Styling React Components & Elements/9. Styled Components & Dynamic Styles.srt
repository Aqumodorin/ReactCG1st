1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:09,860
Now you might also remember that we had a little addition here on this spot and we just worked on when

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,090
we were showing persons then actually the background color of the buttons should change to read and

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:24,260
hear the hover stall should make sure that we styled a button differently if we hover over it basically.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,040
Now how can we change styles conditionally like this when using styled components.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,730
Thankfully it's super super simple.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,710
We have a style button here right.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,980
And we want to change some styles based on some circumstance outside of the component.

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,250
So in this case based on show person's well we're dead we can't just pass a prop to stall button any

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,350
prop of our choice for example all but the name is really up to you and then pass the value in this

10
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,080
case this state show persons.

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,400
So basically the state which is important for us to change the styling and that is to show person style

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,390
because previously we changed styles and if block now I'm just for wording is important state on this

13
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,660
all Prop 2 style button.

14
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,010
Now the only question is how can we use this all prop inside of our styled button component to change

15
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,370
the background color or to hover stalls.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,190
And for that we can use a neat feature this year with the back takes is a template literal it's regular

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,090
javascript which in the end creates a string.

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,640
Now that is a string where we can dynamically inject content though with a special syntax.

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,160
And again this is just JavaScript has nothing to do with react.

20
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,810
You can at a dollar sign and then two curly braces here this allows you to dynamically insert something

21
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,230
into this long string which is created here.

22
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:06,420
And here we actually can get a function where we receive props and then we have to return a value we

23
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,580
want to render in this place and there we can check if props all which is that prop I add it down there

24
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,950
if you remember here all if Dad is in the end true in our case here or not

25
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,690
so here we can check of props out with a ternary expression is Data's true then.

26
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,690
Here we want to have a red background.

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,190
Otherwise we want to have that greenback run from before some returning a string here.

28
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:45,690
Now this dynamic expression here is also passed into the spot method and yet automatically by javascript.

29
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:52,280
And this also is a sudden tax or a usage of this template literal which the styled components package

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,210
understands if we inject such a function into dad style string here the styled components package will

31
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,980
have a look at it and will pass in the props that we pass to the button to that function so we can expect

32
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,560
that as argument to that function here and then we can use the props here and returned a text which

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,180
should be output here and which should be used in the style and yen.

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,830
And so therefore now if we save this and this reload you see this still is green but if you click on

35
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:28,940
it it has a red background and this is all done because in the head section if we inspect our styles

36
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:36,890
again you see here we got conditional styles we better get back on color green and we also got the background

37
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:43,040
color red here with a different see says class it's a bit hard to read because it's optimized and compressed

38
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,880
here but here you see background color red.

39
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,620
And up there you see background color green and these are different CSF has classes in the end which

40
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,890
are used to add these colors and the style components package will simply swap these classes here if

41
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:03,800
you inspect the but then watched a class on the right will swap these classes based on our condition.

42
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,570
So that's all the magic quote unquote done by that package.

43
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,910
And of course we can use the syntax here not just in this place but also use it here to have Selman

44
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:25,860
as a background color or light green or all the down there a color which I used before of black.

45
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,060
So that doesn't change.

46
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,120
So we don't need to change it here we don't need to add this special syntax here.

47
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,860
So with that if we now reload if I click it we have a red button with a Salmond background if I hover

48
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,840
over it or we're not viewing persons have a green button with a light green button.

49
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,070
These are styled components and styled components is a package which gives us a very popular way of

50
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:58,850
combining CSX and JavaScript where we write normal CSX but we mix it with this javascript syntax and

51
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,920
installed components package then does all the magic of extracting this putting it into a C as is class

52
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,920
and adding this class dynamically to this button which does spot method in this case creates and then

53
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,530
we can use this here as a regular react component which just happens to have some styles attached to

54
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:16,970
it.

55
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:23,100
Therefore style components are definitely also a package I can recommend that you have a look at if

56
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,350
you're looking into styling your components.
