1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,770
In the last lectures we had a look at props, props simply an object giving us access to all the attributes

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,920
we pass to our own components.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:20,510
Now sometimes you don't want to get some information from outside but you want to have it inside a component

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,910
and change it from inside there too.

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:33,830
So for example here in our app.js file, let's say we also want to add a button which if we click

6
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,350
it simply switches

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,450
one of the names we use here,

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,890
so where we simply put a caption of switch name maybe. We'll come to handling this click event in

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,120
the next lectures

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:55,010
but first of all, we need to define these names here in a non-hardcoded way.

11
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:01,190
Right now it's hardcoded into our JSX code and this is okay here but if we later want to change

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,040
it, we have to store it in some variable or something like that.

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,040
Well this actually is a class and a class has properties,

14
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,200
this is not just the case in Javascript but in other programming languages too.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,670
You can kind of think of a property as a variable of a class,

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:30,650
so in normal Javascript code, you would simply write var something equals some value.

17
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,440
This doesn't work in a class, there

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,730
you can simply write something equals some value,

19
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:46,160
so a bit shorter but in the end, the same you could say. There is one special property you can define

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,340
in any component which extends component. So you can't do it in person,

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,780
you can't define properties here anyways because that's a normal function,

22
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,290
so here you would have to use some constants or some variables.

23
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:08,000
Still what we're about to do only works in components which are created by extending component. There

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,690
we can define a special property named state, whereas props are set and passed from outside like name

25
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,800
and age into the person component,

26
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,420
state is managed from inside a component.

27
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,950
Now important, this state property here is only available like this in components that extend components,

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,540
so in class-based React components.

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,470
Now actually with React 16.8, a new feature was released called React hooks on which I'll have a whole

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,300
module towards the end of the course and which I'll also already introduce in this module here a little

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,020
later and with that new feature, you can actually also manage state in functional components.

32
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,850
Now for now, we'll not use that though,

33
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,210
I'll talk about this in more detail later in this module and therefore we'll add state here in this

34
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,070
class-based component which is the default way of adding it. Still

35
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:08,090
you should use functional components as often as possible because you should useState with care because

36
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,120
having state in all your components and manipulating it from anywhere in your app makes your app quickly

37
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,560
unpredictable and hard to manage especially as it grows.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,020
Of course it doesn't mean you shouldn't use it at all though,

39
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,190
here it makes perfect sense.

40
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:28,950
We initialize it by assigning a value and this value is a Javascript object.

41
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:38,090
Again this is a reserved word and we should use it if we want to manage, well some component internal

42
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,600
data

43
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:45,140
you should say. So now the state could have some persons,

44
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,740
this is totally up to you,

45
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:54,130
I simply create a persons property in this Javascript object and this will be an array and you can set

46
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,800
up any kind of data you want in this state object,

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,690
you could set up a name property which is some name, you can really manage whatever you want, here

48
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,870
I want to manage an array of persons though.

49
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:15,820
Now this persons array again is an array of Javascript objects where each object has a name,

50
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,600
maybe Max and an age, maybe 28, a number here not a string, unlike down there

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,270
where we do pass a string but a number is fine for me here.

52
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,750
I also want to have another one here,

53
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,920
name Manu and age 29 and a third one,

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,830
you guessed it, for Stephanie which has an age of 26.

55
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,560
Now this is my state,

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:53,090
we can now access a property like this and that's not just true for state but for any property in our

57
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:00,500
render method by simply outputting something dynamic with single curly braces as you learned it and then

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:09,100
the this keyword. This refers to the class due to our ES6 syntax we're using

59
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:16,460
and on our class, we have a render method we could call, we shouldn't do that though, React does that but

60
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,130
we have a state property and as I said, you can also define your own properties but state is a special

61
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,800
one as you will learn over the next lectures.

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,500
So here we can then access this state and on state, my persons array,

63
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,770
there maybe the first element by using index 0 and then the name.

64
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,970
So instead of hardcoding it, I'm now accessing this property in this object here in the persons array

65
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,460
on the state property.

66
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:55,670
Now I'll copy this code here and replace my age with it too, there I of course want to access the age property

67
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,860
and I'll replicate this for Manu

68
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,770
but here it's of course the second element with index one in this array and for the

69
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,760
age, I'll also access element one

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,080
and of course the age property.

71
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,500
And for Stephanie, you probably guessed it, index two

72
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,090
and also for the age, index two and age

73
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,240
property. With that if we save this and we go back to the application, we see the button which doesn't

74
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:33,380
do anything and we see the same output as before, this time using a property, the state property though.

75
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,490
Now I said state would be a special property,

76
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:45,820
thus far we don't use it in a special way though, we can change this. State can be changed and if it changes

77
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:52,660
and that's the special thing about it and it only works on that state property, if it changes, it will

78
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,130
lead React to re-render our DOM or to update the DOM I should say.

79
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:09,550
So if we change the name of Max here for example, this will lead to this being re-rendered

80
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,400
and let me prove it to you by also showing you how to listen to events like clicking on this button.
