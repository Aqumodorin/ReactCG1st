00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:08,270
In the last lecture I highlighted why we want to set up a project which gives us some additional features

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:14,720
which make our life as a developer easier now as I also mentioned there is a tool which creates such

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,990
a project for us.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,100
It's called Create react app and you can simply google for it to find a link to its official github

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,450
repository.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:31,620
As I said it's maintained by basically Facebook or a community around Facebook so it's officially recommended

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,750
tool for creating react projects on that github page.

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,190
You will find installation instructions and a detailed explanation about what it does and how it works.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,090
Feel free to read it but of course you're also going to learn all about that throughout this course.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,590
So let's start with the installation.

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:59,840
We install it globally with NPM and NPM as simply nodes package manager a tool you automatically get

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,610
when installing node J.S. which makes it easy to manage third party packages.

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:12,890
Other javascript packages in the end and create reactive is just such a package to use NPM.

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,590
You need to install node J.S. which you can download and install from node J.S. dot org.

15
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,510
Now there you should pick the latest version 8 dot 5.

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,870
In my case here.

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,080
But if you're facing any issues with that all to try out where's the six study eleven or what average

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,400
long term support version is in your case when you're viewing this page now.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,800
No worries we're not going to write any note J.S. code here.

20
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,880
You don't need to know.

21
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,930
Note J.S. we only need it to use its package manager and also for this development server which will

22
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,360
be spun up for us automatically.

23
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,360
So simply click these buttons download and no chance and it will open up installer through which you

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,430
can walk.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,670
Once you did finished installation you should be able to run the NPM command here on your machine.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,590
So let's do this together in the next step.

27
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,710
Now to use d create react app tool use simply open up a terminal or a command prompt on your machine

28
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,420
and then there you run npm install and that's what you need node James for.

29
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:28,710
It gives you that NPM tool npm install create dash react dash app and then important add dash G after

30
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:35,350
this to install it globally on your machine so that you can use this command from anywhere on your machine.

31
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,380
Now on windows you can simply hit enter on Mac and Linux you might need to add sudo in front of this.

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,950
If you hit enter and get a permission error to get the right permissions after you did hit Enter you're

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,340
probably prompt to enter your password and you might want to enter correctly the first time.

34
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,580
Unlike I did but after all that create react app should be installed.

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,150
Now you can use that command to create a new project and you do so by running create react app and then

36
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,300
the name of your project and off the folder into which it will be installed.

37
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,500
Now important before you run this command navigate into the powerful your system where you want to create

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,480
that new folder.

39
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,280
So here I'm on the desktop but with the help of S.D. you can of course navigate into a different path

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,980
to store your project there then run create react app and then the name of your project which could

41
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:33,430
be my app or react dash complete guide for example because that is what this course is about.

42
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,510
Now one important note to get the exact same folder structure as I have it since this changes over time

43
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,050
a bit and you follow along perfectly.

44
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,690
You have to add something to this command so don't hit enter yet instead add a whitespace a blank and

45
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,590
then add dash dash scripts.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,100
Werman So this is all one and the same command even though it's split in two lines here on my machine

47
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:03,000
but it's one command so dash dash scripts dash where John and then a whitespace then one dot one dot

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,090
five.

49
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,540
Now this does not impact the question of react.

50
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,290
You're using you are using the latest version of react no worries.

51
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,280
This simply impacts the structure of the project.

52
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,010
We will change that structure for the course any.

53
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,750
But to start with the same well starting point.

54
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,580
Use this command simply hit enter their offer and a new project will be created for you.

55
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,740
So this will now create a new folder and set everything up for you.

56
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,450
There you can ignore all the warnings you might be getting here.

57
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,370
Everything will be fine no worries.

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,730
So let's wait for this command to finish.

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,460
Now and once this is finished you'll see a bunch of commands you can run.

60
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,850
Now here you see ya and start ya and build.

61
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,240
That is because I have installed yarn which is an alternative to NPM on my machine queue.

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,970
You will all will who run these commands with NPM run start NPM run build and so on.

63
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,120
So first of all though you have to navigate into the newly created folder.

64
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,050
So with S.D. react that complete dash guide if you named the project like I did here and then in there

65
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,950
you can run NPM start to start your project and what this means is it starts a development server which

66
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,280
opens a new tab in the browser or at least should open that tab in case it does and you can manually

67
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,290
open a browser tab and visit local host Colon Free thousand there.

68
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:28,420
And this is a first project first demo app that well is created for you which we can now edit this process

69
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,630
here.

70
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,260
The NPM start process should be kept on running don't quit it.

71
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,950
You can always quit it by hitting control and see but if you quit it it will stop watching your files.

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,660
And as long as it keeps running on the other end it is watching your files and what does this mean.

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,150
It means that whenever you change something in code this page will automate you reload and reflect the

74
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,040
latest changes which is awesome.

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,570
So as soon as you're done developing you can quit this as long as you are developing keep this process

76
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,580
running.

77
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,920
Now with that process running again and that application running here on local host three thousand let's

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,340
have a look at the folder that was created and all the files we find in there.

79
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,290
In the next lecture.
