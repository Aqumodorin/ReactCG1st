00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,030
So let's get started with this course.
1

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,200
But first, I want to explain to you how you can get the most out of this course.
2

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,950
Obviously, you'll watch the videos and I highly recommend that you also code along; write
3

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,260
the code yourself.
4

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,640
This is how you'll learn the most.
5

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,110
Additionally, check my source code
6

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:27,170
if you're encountering issues. You can find it attached to the end of each module and also to a lot
7

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,170
of lectures throughout the module. I provide the source code because sometimes it's just a tiny typo
8

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,770
and if you then run my source code and compare it to yours, you will be able to find out what's wrong
9

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,360
in your code and get a deeper understanding of why it went wrong.
10

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,640
Also, consider the many hints and things
11

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,970
I will teach you in the debugging section of this course.
12

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,560
There, I will teach you how to handle React errors and how to react to them and fix them;
13

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,470
definitely something you have to know how to do.
14

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,460
So use that knowledge you gain there to fix any issues you encounter.
15

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,070
Now, if you're stuck and you can't find the error, ask in the Q&A section.
16

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,940
My team and I are more than happy to help you. But, this is important,
17

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,500
don't just ask but
18

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,360
also answer in the Q&A.
19

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,970
I'm not saying this because I don't want to answer your questions.
20

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,220
I will, but if you answer, you'll learn way more than if you just ask.
21

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,740
Asking is super-simple; but answering is hard.
22

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,580
You can't go wrong and
23

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,850
even if your answer is wrong, no one is going to kill you.
24

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:39,380
Instead, you're going to learn if people correct you and answering forces you to think about a problem
25

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,820
and find a solution.
26

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,630
If you really want to become a great React developer, you have to solve problems and answering the Q&A
27

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:55,150
section is a good way of practicing just that. Finally, practice, practice, practice;
28

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,540
it's as easy as that.
29

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,390
Even after you've finished this course, you've got to practice the things you've learned.
30

31
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:07,850
You have to build your own demo projects, set your own challenges, do the exercises from this course, alter
31

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,630
the code you'll learn in this course and practice React.
32

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,900
If you follow these steps and follow through this entire course, you'll be an awesome React developer
33

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,410
and you'll be able to apply for jobs,
34

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,850
become a React freelancer; whatever you want. With that,
35

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,520
let's dive into React and learn how it works.
