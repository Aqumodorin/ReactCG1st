00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,470
So, in the last lecture I explained that React is all about components and that components are awesome.
1

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,760
Let's actually see this on a real web page. Here's reactjs.org,
2

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,280
which is the official web page
3

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,030
of the React team.
4

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,550
If we have a look at it, it is actually built with React (of course).
5

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,530
This looks like a normal web page and it is; but we can split this up into components.
6

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,380
We've got this Header component and in there we've got these Single Navigation Item components.
7

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:42,030
We've got this Starting Image/Call-To-Action component here and we've got all our elements down here
8

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,860
where they advertise React and what it is about. We see more components here like these Image Code Snippet
9

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,040
components with some descriptions to the left of them.
10

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,400
All these things are basically building blocks which we can of course easily consider as reusable pieces
11

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,880
and actually they are reusing this element here.
12

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,890
We've got one element here and then the same element with different content being used below it.
13

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,810
Now, you can hard-code all this with just HTML, JavaScript and CSS, but then you will
14

15
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,050
have to repeat your code over and over again. Here, with components,  you build your own HTML elements,
15

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,970
so to say, and then you just reuse those elements.
16

17
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,560
Behind the scenes, this HTML element has all this content already inside of it and we'll see this
17

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,680
in detail in a second.
18

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,080
Another good example would be Udemy. Here on the Udemy page where I searched for Vue.js
19

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,130
(an alternative to React),
20

21
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,880
we see there are a lot of components too.
21

22
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,830
We've got this whole Header with the Search Bar component.
22

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,580
We've got this Search Results Summary component that allows us to filter the search results
23

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,290
and we also have the search results themselves.
24

25
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,540
We've got reused List Item components here.
25

26
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,060
Each of them has an image and a different title,
26

27
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,680
but in the core they are all the same.
27

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
They all have the same structure
28

29
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:13,440
and Udemy also uses a JavaScript framework to achieve this and to allow for easier development and,
29

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,760
this is important,
30

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,820
maintaining and updating this page.
31

32
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,970
So this is why components are awesome and why we as a developer probably want to use components and that
32

33
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,680
is why React is all about components.
