My name is Maximilian Schwartz Miller and I'm a freelance web developer.

Andrew react developer I worked with react a lot and I can tell you it's an amazing library for creating

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,630
highly reactive and super fast javascript driven Web applications.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,850
The javascript driven part is especially important because since react is a javascript library it's

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:34,480
of course about writing your web apps in JavaScript and that in turn is amazing because since javascript

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,850
runs in the browser it allows you to create super fast Web apps that feel like mobile apps.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:49,030

And way more than that you will learn what react is about how it works and why you might want to use

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:01,880
