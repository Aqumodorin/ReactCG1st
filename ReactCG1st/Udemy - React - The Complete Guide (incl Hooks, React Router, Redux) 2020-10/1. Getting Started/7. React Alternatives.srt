Now, there's not just React;

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,330
there are also alternatives. React, of course, is what we'll cover in this course.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,350
There is also Angular and Vue.js as well as others like Backbone and Ember, but
3

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,730
Angular and Vue are the most popular alternatives.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,330
I can only recommend diving into these two to really pick your favorite.

00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,250
I've also got courses on them if you're interested.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,500
All three of them are great at creating highly-scalable web applications that look and feel good to
7

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,090
the user.

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:41,050
Not so much an alternative is jQuery; where he you might think it is, but jQuery is really only about
9

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,820
traversing the DOM and targeting elements in the DOM.
10

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,490
Now, as you saw in our example, React is about just declaring what you see and focusing on the logic
11

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,050
instead of focusing on the 'how'. Therefore, React, Angular and Vue allow you to create more powerful
12

13
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,860
applications because you can focus on the logic and your business model and not so much on the technical
13

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,450
side of actually reaching an element
14

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,670
you want to change.
