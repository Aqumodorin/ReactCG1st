00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,460
So we already got our hands dirty and we saw how we build a React app.
1

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,620
Now, this already answers a bit why we might want to use React.
2

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,730
There's also more.
3

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:20,760
There are more reasons why we want to use React. React helps us with a problem we'll encounter with normal
4

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,900
JavaScript; the UI state becomes difficult to manage. In bigger JavaScript applications,
5

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,520
you have to manually target elements in your DOM and if you then change the structure of your HTML
6

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,470
code, chances are you will need to change the way you targeted your elements because you used querySelector.
7

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,610
Even if you use jQuery, traversing the DOM is easier, but it's still always something you have to
8

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,590
keep in mind.
9

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,020
If you've got more complex web apps where you dynamically add and remove elements, this quickly can
10

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,640
become cumbersome. In our course project, we build an app which is highly dynamic where we are able to build
11

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
a burger and dynamically add and remove ingredients.
12

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,040
If you write this with normal JavaScript code, it's going to be a nightmare.
13

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,370
So React helps us by making the whole UI state management a non-issue.
14

15
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,440
It allows us to focus on our business logic instead of keeping our application from exploding.
15

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,400
Additionally, React is maintained by a big community.
16

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,510
So chances are, the React code is written better than we could have ever written it.
17

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,480
So therefore, it's highly-efficient and fast.
18

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,850
The bigger your application gets, the more this matters too.
19

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,370
Finally, React features a huge ecosystem and an extremely-active community which means that there
20

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,210
is a great chance that for a given problem you face, you'll find a solution or an extra package you can
21

22
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,770
add to fix it.
22

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,960
All these are reasons why React is awesome and why you definitely should consider it for your next
23

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,440
project and why you made the right choice to start with this course.
