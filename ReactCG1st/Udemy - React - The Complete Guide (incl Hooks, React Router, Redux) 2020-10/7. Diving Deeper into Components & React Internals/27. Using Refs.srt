1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,060
By now, we had a super deep dive into many amazing features about React components and by the way, no

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,000
worries if that is getting a lot to remember,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,830
you'll see a lot of that throughout this course, in the course project and in other modules.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,680
So this is really just there to get it out of the way, to introduce you to a concept,

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,090
you'll see it applied then throughout this course and therefore, this will become clearer and clearer

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,770
as we use the different things you learned about.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,650
We're not done yet though. In person component, we have that input where we can change the name of a person,

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,040
right? Now the approach or the way of changing this is absolutely fine here,

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,310
however if you want to get access to an HTML element like this input

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,470
but actually what I'm about to show you works with any HTML element, with any JSX element I

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,540
should say here,

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,980
then you are not limited to setting up two-way binding because that of course is nice for getting the

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,170
value you entered

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,790
but let's say you want to focus that input,

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,870
let's say when we render all our persons here, the last person should automatically receive focus.

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,430
Well then this is kind of hard to do here right,

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,750
how do we focus this? In regular Javascript,

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,580
you could of course write something like in componentDidMount, so right after this rendered

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,030
let's say, you could use document.querySelector, select your input and on that input, you could then

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,250
call the focus method.

21
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,430
Now if we try that actually and componentDidMount works here of course because it's a class-based component,

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,660
if I try that, then I do indeed focus but I focus the first one simply because document.querySelector

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,600
selects the first input it finds here and additionally, this is not really that great because it doesn't

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,420
refer to the input rendered by this component, otherwise it would render the last input because that

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,220
was the last component rendered,

26
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:08,990
so this code here actually executed the last time in that last person component and it didn't focus the

27
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,140
input of that person component but still, the first input it found on the entire page because document.querySelector

28
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,850
is not something that is related to React,

29
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:27,020
it is a general web or browser feature, a general DOM selector and it always works on the entire DOM,

30
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,580
it doesn't care whether we use React or not and therefore, this is not the optimal way of selecting this.

31
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:40,220
Sure we could set up an ID here to select it by ID but React actually has an easier way for us to

32
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:48,410
select an element, a concept called refs which stands for references. On any element and that does really

33
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,760
mean not just on inputs but on any element including your own components,

34
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:00,710
you can add a special ref keyword. Now ref, just like key, is a special property you can pass into any

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,010
component, it is detected and understood by React.

36
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,240
Now ref can be used in a couple of different ways and here is way number one which is supported in older

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:18,990
versions of React too. You pass a function here and this can be an anonymous arrow function as I'm doing

38
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,470
it here and the argument you're getting is a reference to the element you place this on, 

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,980
so here we could name this inputEl but you can name it whatever you want. In that function body, you then

40
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,270
can use that,

41
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,950
therefore here of course, we could call focus actually but that's not what I want to do here,

42
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,370
instead let's say we want to use that in some other place of the application and therefore what you

43
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,280
can also do is, you can add a new property to your class, so not to your state but really just to the class

44
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,960
by using this, then any name of your choice like input element

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,830
but this can really be name, whatever you want

46
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,770
and this holds the inputEl

47
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,510
we're getting as an argument. So we're getting access to the input element here and then we're storing

48
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,190
this in a global property,

49
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,220
so from that point on we can use it anywhere in our application. And since componentDidMount executes

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,140
after render, input element will have been set by then,

51
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,690
so in here we can call input element focus, excuse me,

52
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:26,830
this input element focus of course because input element is a property of this class and therefore this approach

53
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:34,190
only works in class-based components, not in functional components. If we saved that, it reloads and

54
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,420
if I toggle my persons,

55
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,070
now the last persons input is selected, thanks to this reference.

56
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,070
Now this is one approach of using references but as I mentioned, it's not the only one. Since

57
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,920
React 16.3,

58
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,600
we also have another way of setting up a reference and that includes the constructor or requires us

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,760
to use the constructor

60
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:06,440
and in there, you can now set up your input element, so the same property I'm using down there, input element

61
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:20,010
by calling React create ref. So create ref is a method offered on the React object we're importing

62
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,360
and I'm storing it here in the input element.

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,490
Now that means of course this is not necessarily my input,

64
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,420
this is any reference object React gives me, whatever that is behind the scenes.

65
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,790
You can now use this reference here and therefore I'll name it inputEl, element ref to make it really

66
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:46,890
clear that this is just a reference, you can now use this here instead of passing a function to ref. So

67
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,350
this function approach is OK and therefore I'll comment it out to keep it here but you can now set ref

68
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,140
equal to this input element ref,

69
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:04,410
so to this property you're initializing here in the constructor. This holds an access to this ref object

70
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,400
React gives me and then I'm assigning this to my ref property and behind the scenes, React will make

71
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:17,160
the connection and input element ref will then actually allow me access to the element on which this

72
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,520
ref assignment was placed.

73
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:28,210
So now in componentDidMount, I can use this input element ref, so this ref property and there, I actually

74
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,220
have a current property which you have to access first

75
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,900
and this gives you access to your current reference.

76
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,170
So here, I'll access current and then focus because the current element stored in this reference here

77
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,810
is this element here,

78
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,290
so the input element and that does have a focus method.

79
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,190
So with that, we would always be able to do that.

80
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,340
Now one thing, if you add a constructor, you have to call super here and of course you should forward

81
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,450
the props you're getting here to make sure everything works correctly,

82
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,020
always when you add a constructor, add super first.

83
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,870
So now with that, we got everything set up and now this app reloads and you can see that still the last

84
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,860
person is selected,

85
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,910
thanks to our reference. So you can use either approach, either with React create ref which is the more

86
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,890
modern approach or by using that function form down there to get direct access to the element,

87
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,010
this is the older approach and therefore it also works in older versions of React and it's up to you

88
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,200
to use which version you want depending on which version, the version of React you're using, is allowing

89
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,800
you to use.
