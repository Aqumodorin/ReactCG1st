00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,940
We had a look at the useEffect hook here and I just came up with one interesting change to it here actually.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,830
Now we do have our app here that when it reloads, it gives us this alert, right.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,070
Now what if I remove the cockpit,

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,760
the alert still shows.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,740
Now I explained how we could do cleanup work here,

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,270
why don't we just do it?

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,820
We have that timer which I certainly want to remove if this cockpit component here unmounts and this

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,650
code here runs when it unmounts

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,020
because of that second argument where we have an empty array which ensures that this code executes only

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,420
when a component is mounted and rendered for the first time and when it then is unmounted.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:51,320
So let's actually store our timer here in a constant, timer and let's clear this timeout when we

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,000
umount.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,800
So here I can call clear timeout and pass timer,

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,680
so this constant here. And with that if I save this and this app reloads, now if I remove this, we never see

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,990
the alert because the timer never goes off because I clean it up when this cockpit is unmounted

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,410
and if I do that before the alert shows, so before the timer finished, then it's simply canceled

17
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,360
and of course if I don't do that, then we see the alert.

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,290
So that was just a tiny variation which I came up with after this initial recording which I of course

19
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,730
didn't want to hide from you.

20
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,400
Now I'll remove it here because I don't have it in the code for the next lectures but still, this is a great

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,520
example for how you can do cleanup work in useEffect.
