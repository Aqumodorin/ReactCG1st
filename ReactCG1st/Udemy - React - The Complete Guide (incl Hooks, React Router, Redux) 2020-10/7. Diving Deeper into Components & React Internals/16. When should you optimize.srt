1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,920
Now with the React memo and shouldComponentUpdate, it would be kind of logical to basically add either

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,400
of the two to any component you're creating,

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,840
every functional component could be wrapped with React memo and every class-based component could implement

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,020
shouldComponentUpdate.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,780
Is that wise?

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,510
Now this might sound like a good idea

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,470
but it actually isn't.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:31,100
You will have components that will basically always update when their parent updates.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,040
In such cases where you depend on some input from your parent component, that is about the only data

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,910
your parent component manages and therefore when your parent component updates,

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:47,180
you will also have to update because then that data changed. In such cases if you implement shouldComponentUpdate

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,550
or React memo,

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,500
then these functions will run and will check whether the input changed and they will find out

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,580
yes it changed like it always does and they will allow you to re-render.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,040
So all good, right?

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,170
You didn't stop anything from happening. Well but you executed this unnecessary code.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,500
This check here of course doesn't come for free.

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,630
It's not a super performance heavy check but still, it is code that executes

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,630
and if you wrap all your components with such checks and let's say 60% of your components actually

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,660
always need to update when their parent updates,

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,970
well if you then wrapped all your components with these extra checks, then you're running unnecessary

22
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:35,390
checks on 60% of your component codebase and that is not really something you want to do. So

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,820
you should evaluate this carefully,

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:45,290
is this component part of a parent component that could change related to something that does not affect

25
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,710
me at all, as it is the case here where the persons component is certainly not interested in changes

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,230
related to the cockpit,

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,940
well then you should implement your check here.

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,680
Otherwise if you're pretty sure that in all or almost all cases where your parent updates, you will need

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,820
to update too,

30
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,150
then you should not add shouldComponentUpdate or React memo because you will just execute some extra

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,130
logic that makes no sense and actually just slows down the application a tiny bit.
