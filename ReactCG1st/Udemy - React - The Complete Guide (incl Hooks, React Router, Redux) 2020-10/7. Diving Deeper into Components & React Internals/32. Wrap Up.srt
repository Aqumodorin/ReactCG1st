1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,680
Now that was a lot to digest,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,900
this was a real deep dive module. You learned a lot about React components,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,690
a lot of cool features, some niche features and a lot of features you will encounter throughout this course.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,200
Take this module as a reference module,

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,950
feel free to come back to this module whenever you see something in the course where you're not sure

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,330
about how it works

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,030
or whenever you're working on your own project and you need to use context or you need to use the component

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:41,550
lifecycle. Come back to this module and use this module like a little API reference, showing you

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,430
a lot of advanced or special features of React components that you might need in one use case or the

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,170
other.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,000
And as I mentioned, you will see a lot of these features being used throughout this course which will

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,070
certainly help with understanding and applying them but don't feel bad if you have to go back through

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,630
a video and go through a certain concept.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,030
Again, my goal and intention with this module was and is to give you a broad overview of the many things

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,910
you can do with React components, how you can optimize them and how React gives you a lot of different

16
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,250
features for different problems

17
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,480
you might be facing.
