00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's start with prop types.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,250
Right now we're doing prop type validation in the burger ingredient component.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,400
There we make sure that the type is set,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,010
so it's required and that it is a string.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,260
I'm not doing any validation in any other component

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:26,620
and the reason for this is that here I'm not working on a project which is going to get used by other

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,190
people,

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,550
I'm not working on the third-party library,

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,190
I am not even working in a developer team,

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,780
so a lot of the reasons why properties might be used incorrectly aren't relevant here.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,520
Additionally, we'll get logical errors in our application

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:50,230
if we forget or assign a wrong key property anyways and that is why I don't use prop type validation

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,780
that much in this application.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:59,170
Feel free as a practice to add prop types validation to more components. You can convert them to class

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,070
based components for that or keep them as functional components, doesn't really matter,

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,480
I typically convert it in class-based components also to highlight the difference and to make it really

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,270
clear that I'm adding prop type validation

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,260
but you don't need to do that and I will not add them to all my components but you can definitely do

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,340
this as a practice.
