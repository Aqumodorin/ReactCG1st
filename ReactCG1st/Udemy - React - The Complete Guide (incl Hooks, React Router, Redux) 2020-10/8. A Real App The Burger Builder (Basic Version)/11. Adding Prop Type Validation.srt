1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,020
So let's add prop type validation and for this, I'll cancel the development server and then run npm

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:16,350
install --save, --save to also save an entry in package.json and then prop types.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,220
This is the package I showed you in the last course section which is provided by the React team to validate

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:33,580
the prop types of your React properties. Simply import prop types from prop types and you can start using

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,410
that package, I'll restart the development server with npm start

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,140
and here I want to use prop types on this component.

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,190
Now you don't need to transform into a class-based component actually,

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,290
you can use prop types on functional components as well,

9
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,960
I want to practice this conversion to a class-based component

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,360
once again though and I personally like using prop types on class-based components but you could keep

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,960
this a functional component and add prop types in the same way as I do it on the class-based one.

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,880
Well with that, let's rename BurgerIngredient to have a capital B to follow the naming convention of

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,490
classes and let's import component as a named import from React. Now

14
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:22,740
BurgerIngredient should extend component and we can then add a class body where we need to implement

15
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,090
the render method.

16
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,380
Now inside render, we can now execute our logic, our switch statement and in the end, return the ingredient.

17
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,050
So simply put that in there,

18
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:43,690
remove that relict down there and export your newly named class. Now props type won't work because inside

19
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,300
a class, you access props with this props,

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,540
so make sure to add a this in front of props, with that it should be working again though.

21
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:02,750
Now we can add prop type validation by taking our class name, adding the prop types property with a lowercase

22
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,310
p and setting it equal to a Javascript object and there

23
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:16,280
I now want to configure the type property using the prop types we imported from that prop types package,

24
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:24,640
using that and there, I want to make sure the type should be a string and we can chain another condition

25
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,700
that it is required.

26
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:34,450
So if we ever try to use the ingredient component without passing a type, we will get an error.

27
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,920
So with that, the burger ingredient is finished,

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,280
now of course it would be interested to also see it in action

29
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,900
and for that in the next lecture, we'll actually start building our burger in the burger component.
