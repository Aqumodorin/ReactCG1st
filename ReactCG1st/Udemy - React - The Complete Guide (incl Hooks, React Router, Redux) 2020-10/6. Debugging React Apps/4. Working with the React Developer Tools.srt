1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,050
Now you learned how to read and understand arrow messages and how to find logical errors.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,760
Sometimes you want to know the current state of your react app and wealth.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,700
You might be able to figure that out with the developer tools.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,810
It can be inconvenient.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,080
Thankfully there is a cool extension you can add to Chrome D react.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,740
Developer Tools let's install it together.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,260
You can simply google for react developer tools and you will will find the github repository where you

8
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:38,200
can learn more about them how to use them and can even contribute to the project or you had right to

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,580
the Chrome Web Store.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,860
No no worries these are free in the Chrome Web Store.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,260
I already added them to Chrome but you can click Add to grow if you haven't done so.

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,400
Once you added them you probably need to restart chrome and thereafter in the Chrome developer tools.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,590
You should find queue entries here components and profiler with this react symbol next to them.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,720
And if you click on components you should see something like this year you'll see a representation of

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,560
the react components currently rendered on the screen.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,090
So at the moment this is my app component at the bottom you'll see props.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,990
This component receives end state.

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,240
This component manages.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,130
Now if I click toggle persons be there for all to see all the person components here.

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,630
We can all click on those to see the properties components get which components renders them and so

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,100
on.

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,920
You can also log such a component to the console so that you can dive into it in more detail here.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,650
You can also inspect the matching DOM element which takes you to the elements tab and then show us your

24
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,810
which element is rendered by this concrete component and of course you can also inspect the source code.

25
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,560
You were taken to the source as Taproot can see that blaze breakpoints and so on.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,420
You can also go to the settings here and tweak this a little bit there you can for example change how

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,850
things are displayed in a compact or a comfortable way.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,530
If you have a light or dark mode here you can go to components specifically and also highlight certain

29
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,270
components of a certain type.

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,200
If you wish to but generally the default settings should be fine.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,930
You can all use to select will here select something in the DOM and it automatically selects the react

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,780
component which is responsible for rendering that thing so the react afterwards are a great way of diving

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,080
deeper into this but you cannot just inspect things here.

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,590
Girls would change things.

35
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,280
For example they could change to age prop here and hence here we see 30.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,910
We can of course also change the state and set this to false and it has the same effect as if we clicked

37
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,170
the toggle button.

38
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,990
So it's a great place to play around with your components test different states and props with ease

39
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,080
without having to hard code anything in your code and it's all great for inspecting what you have on

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,910
the screen and understanding what's getting displayed there and why and how things work together.
